I was following along with this video on [How to build a basic web3 app on Flow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEoh9SnjqCk). I wasn't able to test much without a digital wallet to connect. Some other links that looked promising to help create a basic app and/or marketplace on the Flow blockchain:
- [Hello World Pt. 1 - Basics](https://developers.flow.com/build/getting-started/quickstarts/hello-world)
- [Getting Started with the Flow Blockchain](https://nftschool.dev/tutorial/flow-nft-marketplace/)
- [Build your own NFT Marketplace in 10 minutes](https://flow.com/post/nft-marketplace-video-tutorial-flow-blockchain-build-develop-kitty-items)
- [Building a Flow NFT pet store](https://nftschool.dev/tutorial/flow-nft-marketplace/)

Mr. Kost gave direction to move forward with building the app on another blockchain ([FameForgeNFT](https://github.com/Sports-Media-Interns/FameForgeNFT)). As a result, work on this app stopped as of April 22, 2024.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
